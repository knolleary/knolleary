 - This week I have been on "holiday" having [resigned from IBM](/2021/03/16/19-years-7-months-3-days-an-ibmer/).

 - With the kids in school and Jo working, the temptation is to just keep plugging
   away at the next Node-RED feature. There's certainly plenty to do - with the 1.3 release
   just waiting for me to get some documentation written.

   But I need to take some time to decompress. In a couple weeks I start a New Thing
   that's going to keep me very busy - so for now, I relax.

   Tomorrow a bunch of plywood and MDF arrives for a few DIY projects I've got planned.
   That should let me relax whilst keeping a different part of my brain busy.

 - The fact I started these weeknotes on a Tuesday was an entirely random thing - I just
   felt like doing it then and there. The fact I left IBM on a Tuesday and I start the
   New Thing on a Tuesday is one of those weird and happy coincidences.

 - I *think* I'll take a short break from these weeknotes. And then Season 2 will
   start as an ongoing record of the New Thing.
