 - This is my third set of weeknotes, but for nerdy reasons I started counting them
   at 0. I think I regret that already. Off-by-one errors through-out.

 - Working at home means it takes a particular effort to hit the 10,000 step target
  each day. Even if it is an entirely [arbitrary target](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/03/watch-your-step-why-the-10000-daily-goal-is-built-on-bad-science), it's still a target that feels good to hit.
  Not hitting means I've probably spent too long sat in front of the computer - something
  that happens all too often.

  Since the kids have been home-schooling, I've found I'm hitting the target
  more frequently as we make sure the kids are getting enough exercise and not
  stuck in the house all day.

  Looking for the small positives of the various lock-downs we've been in since
  last March, it's true to say we've explored the area around our house far more
  than we would have done otherwise.

  This past weekend we managed a 5 mile loop from our front-door that managed
  to wear the kids out. It wasn't the most picturesque route, but its fun exploring
  the footpaths that join the streets you'd normally drive straight past.

 - In mundane home-office news, I've turned my desk around so I now sit looking
   into the room with the window behind me. I had originally planned to do it
   the other way around - so I could look out of the window, but that would mean
   my webcam would then get a full view of the room and leave nowhere for the mess
   to hide. We decided that wasn't for the best.

   As it is now, the webcam gets a better backdrop without me having to worry
   if there are any clothes drying in the background - something I have only
   been caught out by once...

   You can see it all in action in [this week's Twitch stream](https://youtu.be/eqeuf38Ul_0?t=216).

   I've also mounted my [monitor on an arm](https://amzn.to/3rj53wK) so I could raise
   it up a bit. Works well so far, although some more playing is need to get everything
   in the right place.

   I also need to find a new home for my Raspberry Pi that was [mounted to the back of the monitor](https://www.instagram.com/p/BznvXssJLr9/).
   I'm thinking I'll fix it onto the underside of the desk somehow to keep it
   out of sight.

 - Inspired by a tweet by [Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1355228000548126721)
   I've setup [office hours]((https://calendly.com/knolleary) where anyone can
   book time with me to talk about Node-RED.

   I'm using Calendly to let people sign-up for a time slot without having to do
   the awkward email back and forth to find a free time.

   Calendly provides some really nice options to help manage this. I've told it
   I'm available all day on Fridays for 25 minute calls - but that it should only allow
   a maximum of 4 calls on any one day. It's also synced up with my Google Calendar
   so I can easily block-out times when I'm otherwise unavailable.

   If you want to schedule some time with me for a chat about Node-RED, then
   you can do that [right here](https://calendly.com/knolleary).

 - We've started watching [The Great](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-great).
   More historical costume drama/comedy. The first episode has just dropped off All4
   - which is why we started it at 11pm last night even through Jo had to be up a 6am for work.
   But so far worth a watch if you can find it.

 - I have read about 4 pages of Mythos in the last week. Will do better this week.
   Just not tonight as it's now 11:58pm as I write this. Better get it published
   whilst it's still Tuesday.
